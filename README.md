Anyone whose data cannot be found in the database of the school cannot have access to register a hall.The module that handles the database is the mongodb.
Html and CSS files are created which handles the backend of the program.
The mongodb compass is linked to the Html and CSS file which enables the student to make POST, GET and DELETE requests.
